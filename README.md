## Initial Scraping Behavior 🕒

When scraping a channel for the first time, please note:

- The script will attempt to retrieve the entire channel history, starting from the oldest messages
- Initial scraping can take several minutes or even hours, depending on:
  - The total number of messages in the channel
  - Whether media downloading is enabled
  - The size and number of media files
  - Your internet connection speed
  - Telegram's rate limiting
- The script uses pagination and maintains state, so if interrupted, it can resume from where it left off
- Progress percentage is displayed in real-time to track the scraping status
- Messages are stored in the database as they are scraped, so you can start analyzing available data even before the scraping is complete
